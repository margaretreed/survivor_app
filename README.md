![alt text](/static/images/readme/homepage.png)

Survivor Stats is your go to resource for analysis on voting patterns and alliances in the game of Survivor! Explore seasons and episodes with the aid of data visualization features for identifying who voted *for* whom and who voted *with* whom. For every episode across all 41 seasons of survivor, users can view an interactive arc diagram to highlight the connection between a castaway and who they voted for. Users can also visualize strongest alliances throughout a season with the heat map feature to track how often two castaways vote together.
